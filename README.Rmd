Import and export family tree GEDCOM files to and from tidy dataframes. 

The package is part of the `gedcompendium` ecosystem of packages. This ecosystem enables the handling of `tidyged` objects (tibble representations of GEDCOM files), and the main package of this ecosystem is [`tidyged`](https://jl5000.github.io/tidyged/).


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/allhex.png")
```

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jl5000/tidyged.io")
```

## Example

The easiest way to create a `tidyged` object is to import an existing GEDCOM file. The package comes with some sample GEDCOM files, which can be imported using the `read_gedcom()` function:

```{r}
library(tidyged.io)

my_ged <- read_gedcom(system.file("extdata", "555SAMPLE.GED", package = "tidyged.io"))

class(my_ged)
```

These objects are a subclass of tibbles, which allows the use of existing `tidyverse` functions:

```{r}
print(my_ged, n = Inf)
```

Many other GEDCOM readers will carry out extensive checks on every line of a GEDCOM file ensuring all tags and values are legal, and the grammar is used correctly. The `tidyged.io` package carries out very few checks, relying on the user to check their files beforehand (as described when loading the package). The few checks that are carried out include:

* Ensuring the file has a valid Byte Order Mark which is consistent with that described in the file;
* Ensuring no lines exceed the character limit;
* Ensuring the header is correctly formed;
* Ensuring there is only one header, trailer, and submitter record defined;
* Checking for unsupported date types (only dates in the Gregorian calendar are supported).

The package strives to modify as little of the file as possible on import, however it does ensure tags and some values are in upper/lower case in line with the GEDCOM specification and to ensure the correct functioning of `gedcompendium` packages.

In the future, the `gedcompendium` ecosystem may include a dedicated validation package, but this is currently a low priority.

If you want to export your file as a valid GEDCOM file, you can use the `write_gedcom()` function.
