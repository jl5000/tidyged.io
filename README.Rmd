Import and export family tree GEDCOM files to and from tidy dataframes. 

The package is part of the `gedcompendium` ecosystem of packages. This ecosystem enables the handling of `tidyged` objects (tibble representations of GEDCOM files), and the main package of this ecosystem is [`tidyged`](https://jl5000.github.io/tidyged/).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jl5000/tidyged.io")
```

## Example

The easiest way to create a `tidyged` object is to import an existing GEDCOM file. The package comes with some sample GEDCOM files, which can be imported using the `read_gedcom()` function:

```{r}
library(tidyged.io)

read_gedcom(system.file("extdata", "555SAMPLE.GED", package = "tidyged.io")) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)
```


Many other GEDCOM readers will carry out extensive checks on every line of a GEDCOM file ensuring all tags and values are legal, and the grammar is used correctly. The `tidyged.io` package carries out very few checks, relying on the user to check their files beforehand (as described when loading the package). The few checks that are carried out include:

* Ensuring the file has a valid Byte Order Mark which is consistent with that described in the file;
* Ensuring no lines exceed the character limit;
* Ensuring the header is correctly formed;
* Ensuring there is only one header, trailer, and submitter record defined.

In the future, the `gedcompendium` ecosystem may include a dedicated validation package, but this is currently a low priority.

If you want to export your file as a valid GEDCOM file, you can use the `write_gedcom()` function.
